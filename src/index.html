              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
              more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
            startup. ”

              Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance

            The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and

            get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
            encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
            about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
            hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
            particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
            developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
